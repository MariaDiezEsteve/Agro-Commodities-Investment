#RAWINVESTING
## Agro Commodities Investment

## Description:

RawInvesting is a primary sector investment stock market website focused on Cotton,coffee, corn, sugar and wheat. With a minimalist and readable interface in a simple and very clear user-oriented way.

This informative website is visually attractive (look), and the user will feel comfortable when interacting with the platform (feel) because each attribute that has been created and designed on the platform has a purpose (usability) and several Call To Action to make the purchase and sale of commodities.

Rawinvesting was born with the idea of responding to the need to delve into a very specific market niche that today is not found on the Internet, with the aim of positioning itself in the very near future as the reference website for information in the financial and investment field for Europe and the United States, but with the goal of becoming the first for Spain and Latin America by 2025.

For this reason the website is in an initial process (Beta) that will be updated and improved as time goes by and as market needs evolve.

As we have highlighted in our buyer persona, the profile of our future users of the website are Technical Stock Market Investors in the natural resources sector:
* Investment Banks
* Private investors
* Foreign trade technicians
* Small investors.
